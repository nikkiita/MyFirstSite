        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I recently started with coding. only a few months ago i discoverd what i really want to do for work. I have a passion for computers and would like to know how everything works behind the scene of the web browser. Now i know a little of <strong>HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript</strong>, and i want to learn much more. One day i will be able to make my own application, and then for me i made my goal.</p>

        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        <p class="drawing-decription">I started to draw when i was 10 years old. Art was my passion, everything was around art to do. i went to an Academy but soon realised that drawing was my hobby not suited for a job. Since then i draw when people ask me for a drawing or i have a creative idea that i need to put on paper.</p>
